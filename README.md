# WayWay

WayWay was is a word learning app. I've created it to help me learn a new language after I couldn't find a word learning app that would satisfy my requirements. There are a few things that made me create WayWay:

- some apps have a lot of unnecessary (for me) configuration exposed to the user during the creation of the word entry
- some apps don't have learning modes that I prefer
- some apps have a UI that doesn't satisfy my requirements
- some apps don't have a freemium, or good enough freemium for me

I don't mind paying for a good product, but I haven't seen an app I would want to pay for

So, now I am building a word learning app for myself.
